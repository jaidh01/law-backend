The petition was filed by Nikhil Upadhyay, who has sought to challenge the constitutional validity of several sections of the Waqf Act, 1995, as amended by the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025.\n\nAt the outset, CJI Gavai questioned the maintainability of the petition due to delay. “We will dismiss on the ground of delay. You are challenging the 1995 Act in 2025. Why should challenge to 1995 Act be allowed in 2025?” he asked. Advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, appearing for the petitioner, responded that the 2013 amendment was also under challenge. However, the CJI reiterated concerns over the delay, saying, “Even then, 2013 to 2025—12 years. There is delay.”\n\nUpadhyay then pointed out that the Supreme Court is already entertaining petitions filed in 2020–21 that challenge the Places of Worship Act, 1991, and the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992.\n\nAdditional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati submitted that the Court had previously not agreed to hear a challenge to the Waqf Act, 1995, along with petitions concerning the 2025 Amendment. However, she expressed no objection to the present petition being tagged with the earlier one challenging the 1995 Act.\n\nFollowing the submissions, the bench issued notice and tagged the petition with the ongoing matter. The Union government and all State/UTs have been named as respondents.\n\nIn the petition—Nikhil Upadhyay v. Union of India, W.P.(C) No. 502/2025—the petitioner contends that several sections of the Waqf Act violate fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15, 21, 25, 26, and 27 of the Constitution. The challenge has been raised against Sections 3(r), 4, 5, 6(1), 7(1), 8, 28, 29, 33, 36, 41, 52, 83, 85, 89, and 101 of the Act.\n\nThe petitioner argued that the Waqf Act is discriminatory as it creates a separate legal framework for the administration of Muslim charitable properties, while no such law exists for the religious properties of other communities. He asserted the need for a common and uniform law governing religious trusts and endowments.\n\nSpecific objections include:\n\nThe definition of Waqf under Section 3(r), described as a \"permanent dedication\", which the petitioner argues is vague and beyond judicially manageable standards. He suggests this should be limited to properties acquired in accordance with law.\n\nThe definition of Mutawalli (manager of a Waqf) is alleged to be vague and uncertain.\n\nThe petitioner also objects to public funds being used to cover the cost of verification and survey of Waqf properties, while no similar state-sponsored surveys exist for other religious institutions.\n\nThe matter is now pending further hearing as part of the batch challenging the Waqf Act.\n\nC 23, Lajpat Nagar 3\nNew Delhi 110024, India\n\n info@thelawadvice.com\n +91 78270 83514\n\nCopyright 2022.

The petition, which was earlier admitted by the Court, raises concerns over violations of constitutional rights and the disregard of National Medical Commission (NMC) guidelines.\n\nThe petitioners, including MBBS interns from multiple states, have alleged that several government and private medical colleges are either not paying stipends or are doing so in an arbitrary and inconsistent manner, despite uniform directions issued by the NMC.\n\nThe plea contends that this practice not only violates Article 14 (Right to Equality) and Article 21 (Right to Life and Dignity) of the Constitution, but also places an undue financial burden on young doctors serving in hospitals as part of their mandated training.\n\nThe Bench agreed to hear the matter after the summer recess, with arguments expected to resume in July 2025.\n\nKey Issues Raised:\n• Disparity in Stipend Practices: The petition highlights that while some states pay stipends regularly, others either delay or deny payments altogether.\n• Ignored Guidelines: NMC norms prescribe that all MBBS interns must be paid, but many institutions allegedly flout this without consequence.\n• Impact on Healthcare Delivery: The petitioners argue that the lack of compensation discourages interns and affects their performance in hospital duties.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decision in this case is expected to have a significant impact on the medical education system and could lead to standardized stipend policies for interns across India.","excerpt":"The Supreme Court on Monday scheduled for July 2025 the hearing of a petition filed by medical interns challenging the non-payment of stipends during ...","category":"Supreme Court","subcategory":"Supreme Court","tags":["InternRights","StipendIssue","MBBSInterns","NMCGuidelines"],"source":"Legal Nest","image":"https://i.postimg.cc/zvxRYrZg/SC-to-Hear-Plea-on-Unpaid-MBBS-Interns-in-July.webp","image_caption":"Image related to: SC to Hear Plea on Unpaid MBBS Interns in July","image_alt":null,"image_credit":null,"pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1htCjflGnzDpicK-hCPSFBY6wG2HmpRoM/view?usp=sharing","author_bio":null,"is_featured":false,"mongo_id":"68366fe9e82bb082f904f53b"},{"title":"Table for Two?

Video cameras shall be kept in the custody of Senior Advocate Vijay Hansaria,” the Court stated.\n\nDuring the hearing, a lawyer raised concerns regarding women's representation in the SCBA executive. She referred to the Court’s earlier directions mandating 33 percent representation for women and argued that the Election Committee failed to implement this, declaring results purely on merit. According to her, at least two senior executive posts should have been reserved exclusively for women, irrespective of the number of women who were elected based on votes.\n\nIn response, the Court clarified that its previous orders emphasized \"representation\" rather than \"reservation\" in the strict constitutional sense.\n\nJustice Surya Kant noted, “The intent was to ensure meaningful participation of women in the SCBA, not to apply the concept of reservation as used in public employment and services.”\n\nThe Bench also pointed out that three out of six elected members are women, thereby achieving the objective of inclusive representation. “No further reservation is required,” the Court said.\n\nThe Court remarked that any grievances regarding the Election Committee’s conduct should have been raised during the election process to allow timely intervention. Nonetheless, it assured members that serious allegations, if substantiated, would be personally examined by the judges—provided the complaints are not merely rooted in dissatisfaction with the results.\n\nIn addition, the Bench acknowledged calls for electoral reforms. One notable suggestion was to bar Election Committee members from contesting elections or supporting candidates to maintain impartiality.\n\nJustice Kant emphasized the need for neutrality: “The impartiality of the Election Committee is essential.”\n\nThe Court asked that all suggestions regarding irregularities and reforms be submitted to the Registrar of the Supreme Court and preferably before the next hearing.\n\nThe matter is scheduled for further hearing on July 28.\n\nC 23, Lajpat Nagar 3\nNew Delhi 110024, India\n\n info@thelawadvice.com\n +91 78270 83514\n\nCopyright 2022.

It is only on account of total lack of application of mind and exercise of powers in an arbitrary manner that this Court is flooded with petitions after petitions challenging the orders of the Pharmacy Council of India\", observed a bench of Justice BR Gavai (now CJI) and Justice AG Masih.\n\nWhile setting aside the Pharmacy Council's rejections of certain institutions' approvals, the Court directed the concerned Registrar to forward a copy of the order to the Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, to take suitable action so that \"such unwarranted litigation\" can be avoided in future. \nThe Court was dealing with a batch of 14 cases filed by pharma colleges. In one of the cases, permission for extension of D.Pharm course was granted to the petitioner-institution, subject to inspection throughout the year. However, within a few months, the approval was rejected on the ground that the institution had not submitted its satisfactory compliance regarding various factors.\n\nThe Court opined that before rejecting the approval, Pharmacy Council ought to have carried out an inspection and given the petitioner-institution an opportunity to rectify any lacunae found. \"We find that the respondent/Pharmacy Council of India has acted in an arbitrary manner and therefore the decision dated 09.12.2024 is liable to be set aside\", it said. \n\nInsofar as the Pharmacy Council regularized the said institution's approval for 2024-25, in view of admissions granted to 46 students following the initial grant of permission, the Court observed that the Council had shown a \"charitable attitude\". However, it added, \"when an action of a statutory body is likely to affect the careers of large number of students, such bodies are expected to act in a manner which is in consonance with the principles of natural justice and non-arbitrariness.\"\n\nIn another \"classic example\" of Pharmacy Council's \"arbitrary attitude\", the Court noted that grant of extension of another institution's approval was subject to inspection throughout the year. An inspection was conducted and no deficiencies pointed out, yet the Pharmacy Council rejected the institution's approval. In this backdrop, the Court observed, \n\n\"It is, thus, clear that either the inspection report is not correct, or the Council has not applied its mind to the inspection report. As already observed by us in the matter of even date, we have observed that the respondent/Pharmacy Council of India cannot act in an arbitrary manner when such an action adversely affects the careers of thousands of students.\"\n\nAppearance: Solicitor General Tushar Mehta; Senior Advocates Devadutt Kamat, Sanjay Sharawat and Neeraj Jain\n\nCase Title: SHREE RAM COLLEGE OF PHARMACY Versus PHARMACY COUNCIL OF INDIA, W.P.(C) No. 24/2025 (and connected cases)","excerpt":"The Supreme Court slammed the Pharmacy Council of India over arbitrary rejection of pharma college approvals and directed the concerned Registrar to forward a copy of the order to the Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.","category":"Supreme Court","subcategory":"Supreme Court","tags":["Supreme Court","Pharmacy Council","Education","Law"],"source":"Legal Nest","image":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1601299/pexels-photo-1601299.jpeg","image_caption":"Image related to: Supreme Court Slams Pharmacy Council Of India Over Arbitrary Rejection Of Pharma College Approvals","image_alt":null,"image_credit":null,"pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1htCjflGnzDpicK-hCPSFBY6wG2HmpRoM/view?usp=sharing","author_bio":null,"is_featured":false,"mongo_id":"68366fe9e82bb082f904f530"},{"title":"Supreme Court Recognizes Maternity Leave as Fundamental Reproductive Right","slug":"supreme-court-recognizes-maternity-leave-as-fundamental-reproductive-right","author":"Legal Nest","published_date":"2025-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","content":"In a landmark judgment on Friday, the Supreme Court of India declared that maternity leave is not just a workplace benefit but a fundamental part of women's reproductive rights.\n\nThe ruling came from a bench comprising Justice Abhay S. Oka and Justice Ujjal Bhuiyan, who emphasized that no institution—public or private—can deny a woman her entitlement to maternity leave.\n\nThe case was brought by a government school teacher from Tamil Nadu, who had been denied maternity leave following the birth of her child from her second marriage. Authorities refused her request on the basis of a state rule limiting maternity benefits to the first two children.\n\nThe petitioner argued that although she had two children from her first marriage, she had not availed of maternity leave or benefits at that time, as she was not employed. She began working only after her second marriage and sought leave for her third child—her first while in service.\n\nRepresented by Advocate K.V. Muthukumar, the petitioner contended that the state's decision was discriminatory and infringed upon her fundamental rights, especially since she had not previously benefited from the state’s maternity provisions.\n\nThe Supreme Court sided with the petitioner, effectively expanding the interpretation of maternity benefits. It ruled that maternity leave must be seen as an essential component of a woman’s reproductive rights, reinforcing the state's obligation to uphold those rights.\n\nThe judgment also revisits the broader framework of the Maternity Benefit Act. As per existing provisions, women are entitled to 26 weeks of paid maternity leave, an increase from the earlier 12 weeks following a 2017 amendment. The law also extends 12 weeks of leave to women who adopt a child.\n\nThis decision marks a significant step forward in reinforcing gender equity and protecting the rights of working women in India.\n\nC 23, Lajpat Nagar 3\nNew Delhi 110024, India\n\n info@thelawadvice.com\n +91 78270 83514\n\nCopyright 2022.

Upon his switch to another bank, the Appellant made the Respondent pay ₹2 lakh penalty, against which the Respondent filed a writ petition before the High Court. Aggrieved by the High Court's decision declaring the execution of bond as restrictive trade practices under Section 27 of the Contract Act, the Bank appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nSetting aside the High Court's decision, the judgment authored by Justice Bagchi emphasized that exclusivity clauses cannot be termed as restrictive of trade practices under Section 27 of the Contract Act, as such clauses do not restrict future employment but only impose a financial penalty for early exit.\n\n\"A plain reading of clause 11(k) shows restraint was imposed on the respondent to work for a minimum term i.e., three years and in default to pay liquidated damages of ₹2 Lakhs. The clause sought to impose a restriction on the respondent's option to resign and thereby perpetuated the employment contract for a specified term. The object of the restrictive covenant was in furtherance of the employment contract and not to restrain future employment. Hence, it cannot be said to be violative of Section 27 of the Contract Act.\"\n\nThe Court rejected the Respondent's argument that such exclusivity clauses were unconscionable and part of a standard-form contract with no negotiation scope. Instead, the Court stated such clause to be reasonable given the fact that public sector undertakings need to retain skilled staff, and early exit prompts them to incur high costs of re-recruitment.\n\n\"The appellant-bank is a public sector undertaking and cannot resort to private or ad-hoc appointments through private contracts. An untimely resignation would require the Bank to undertake a prolix and expensive recruitment process involving open advertisement, fair competitive procedure lest the appointment falls foul of the constitutional mandate under Articles 14 and 16.\", the court said.\n\nThus, the Court justified the imposition of ₹2 lakhs penalty, stating that it was not excessive for a Respondent, who was a Senior Manager (MMG-III) drawing a lucrative salary.","excerpt":"The Supreme Court upheld a bank's employment bond penalty, outlining key principles for interpreting standard-form contracts and their enforceability under Indian law.","category":"Supreme Court","subcategory":"Supreme Court","tags":["Supreme Court","Employment Bond","Justice JB Pardiwala and Justice R Mahadevan","Order I Rule 10 CPC","SULTHAN SAID IBRAHIM VERSUS PRAKASAN & ORS."],"source":"Legal Nest","image":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1601299/pexels-photo-1601299.jpeg","image_caption":"Supreme Court - Legal proceedings","image_alt":null,"image_credit":null,"pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1htCjflGnzDpicK-hCPSFBY6wG2HmpRoM/view?usp=sharing","author_bio":null,"is_featured":false,"mongo_id":"68366fe9e82bb082f904f531"},{"title":"Delhi High Court Denies Bail in Army Espionage Case, Citing National Security Concerns","slug":"delhi-hc-espionage-bail-denied","author":"Legal Nest","published_date":"2025-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","content":"The Delhi High Court has rejected the bail plea of Mohsin Khan, an accused in an Army espionage case, citing grave concerns over national security.\n\nJustice Swarana Kanta Sharma, who presided over the matter, underscored that acts of espionage strike at the very core of the nation's integrity and sovereignty, and must therefore be dealt with stringently.\n\nThe prosecution alleged that Khan played a central role in transmitting confidential information related to the Indian Army to the Pakistan High Commission.

During his tenure, he delivered several significant judgments, particularly in criminal law and public interest litigations.\n\nJustice Bishnoi is widely respected for his no-nonsense judicial approach and clarity in reasoning. Some of his notable contributions include:\n\nUpholding women's rights in marital and property disputes.\n\nAdvocating for judicial transparency and effective case management.\n\nStrongly emphasizing accountability in public institutions, especially in cases involving administrative lapses.\n\nHis verdicts have often balanced legal propriety with social sensitivity, marking him as a judge with both intellect and empathy.\n\nThe Supreme Court Collegium, while recommending his elevation, acknowledged Justice Bishnoi's:\n\nMerit, integrity, and judicial acumen\n\nExtensive experience of over a decade on the High Court Bench\n\nStrong regional representation from Rajasthan, ensuring geographical diversity in the apex court\n\nIt is notable that at the time of his elevation, Justice Sandeep Mehta in the Supreme Court is from the Rajasthan High Court.\n\nWhat sets Justice Bishnoi apart is his grassroots understanding of legal realities. Coming from a state with a vast rural population and complex social dynamics, his judgments often reflect a keen awareness of the common citizen's challenges in accessing justice.\n\nAs a Supreme Court judge, it is expected that he will bring this real-world insight to constitutional interpretation, especially in matters concerning criminal justice reforms, rural access to justice, and gender equity.\n\nSenior advocates and members of the Bar across Rajasthan and Delhi have welcomed his elevation:\n\n\"Justice Bishnoi’s presence in the Supreme Court will reinforce practical reasoning and constitutional discipline,\" said a senior advocate from Jodhpur.\n\n\"He represents a rare combination of humility, diligence, and judicial courage,\" added a retired High Court judge who worked closely with him.\n\nWith several crucial matters pending before the Supreme Court—including those related to criminal procedure reforms, service law interpretation, and constitutional challenges—Justice Bishnoi’s contribution will be closely watched.\n\nHis elevation comes at a time when judicial efficiency, sensitivity, and reform-oriented thinking are the need of the hour. The legal community hopes that his grounded and thoughtful approach will add substantial value to the highest court of the land.\n\nC 23, Lajpat Nagar 3\nNew Delhi 110024, India\n\n info@thelawadvice.com\n +91 78270 83514\n\nCopyright 2022.

Rajasekhar Reddy, the prime accused in the ₹3,200-crore Andhra Pradesh liquor scam, dismissing his petition that termed the arrest as \"illegal.\"\n\nReddy, an IT advisor to former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, was taken into custody last month by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the state government.\n\nA division bench led by Justice JB Pardiwala found “no merit” in Reddy’s plea challenging his arrest, though the court clarified that he remains free to seek regular bail through appropriate legal channels.\n\nAccording to the remand report submitted to a local court on April 22, the SIT has alleged that Reddy played a central role in a conspiracy to manipulate the state's liquor procurement system between 2019 and 2024. The investigation suggests that under his direction, several popular national liquor brands were deliberately sidelined in favour of newly introduced \"blue-eyed\" brands. These new brands allegedly benefitted from significantly larger order volumes, often exceeding regulatory limits.\n\nThe report further claims that kickbacks were collected per case—₹150 for low-cost brands, ₹200 for mid-range, and up to ₹600 for premium brands. These funds were allegedly routed through Reddy and distributed among leaders of the Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP).\n\nThe SIT has described the case as involving criminal conspiracy, cheating, criminal breach of trust, corruption, and money laundering.

I called my dear friend Anil Ambani—he couldn’t say no. I told Adani he’s the emperor of India now—he gave ₹5 crore. Birla and Mittal pitched in with ₹5 crore each. I asked the Ambani family to give ₹10 crore—and they did. Torrent Group joined with ₹5 crore,” Sibal said to enthusiastic applause.\n\nThanks to the ₹50 crore corpus, SCBA members will now receive a completely free, cashless group health insurance plan supported by United India Insurance. Key features of the scheme include:\n\n₹2 lakh cover per family\n\nInclusion of parents and in-laws\n\nCoverage of pre-existing conditions from day one\n\nCashless treatment at over 15,000 hospitals across India\n\n₹50,000 maternity benefit (for both normal and C-section deliveries)\n\nCoverage for congenital conditions, LASIK surgery, and ambulance services\n\n“This isn’t just a policy—it’s a lifeline,” said Sibal. “Young lawyers come to court with dreams, but without a safety net. This is our way of telling them—we’ve got your back.”\n\nChief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud also addressed the gathering, underscoring the importance of nurturing the next generation of legal professionals.\n\n“The journey of the Supreme Court is inseparable from that of the Constitution. And it’s not just about the judges—it’s about both the bar and the bench,” he said. “It is now our collective responsibility to support and uplift young lawyers. I urge bar associations across the country to raise funds for this cause.”\n\nThe event also saw the release of Pillars of Justice, a commemorative book featuring critical essays on landmark Supreme Court judgments. The collection aims to inspire and challenge young legal minds.\n\n“The book is meant for young academics—to read, critique, and evolve legal thought,” said Sibal. Contributors to the volume include noted legal scholars and advocates such as Gautam Bhatia, Rohit Sharma, Jhanvi Sindhu, Vikramaditya Narayan, Astha Sharma, and others.\n\nC 23, Lajpat Nagar 3\nNew Delhi 110024, India\n\n info@thelawadvice.com\n +91 78270 83514\n\nCopyright 2022.

Oka, who demits office today.\n\nThe Supreme Court Collegium, comprising the five senior-most judges, plays a crucial role in the appointment of judges to the apex court and in the transfer of High Court judges. For High Court appointments, decisions are taken by the three senior-most judges of the Collegium.\n\nAt the beginning of Chief Justice DY Chandrachud’s tenure, the Collegium included Justices Surya Kant, Abhay S Oka, Vikram Nath, and JK Maheshwari. With Justice Oka’s retirement on May 24, Justice Nagarathna—currently the fifth senior-most judge—will step into the Collegium starting tomorrow.\n\nShe will remain a member of the Collegium until her retirement in October 2027, which includes her historic elevation as the 55th Chief Justice of India. Although her tenure as CJI will last only 36 days—from September 24 to October 29, 2027—it will mark a significant milestone as the first woman to hold the top judicial post in India. Her term will be the third-shortest for any CJI in Supreme Court history.\n\nJustice Nagarathna is the daughter of former Chief Justice of India ES Venkataramiah, who served as the 19th CJI. She began her legal practice in 1987 with KESVY & Co before shifting to independent practice in 1994, handling matters related to constitutional, administrative, commercial, and family laws.\n\nHer judicial career began with her appointment as an additional judge of the Karnataka High Court in 2008. She was made permanent in 2010 and later elevated to the Supreme Court on August 31, 2021.\n\nAs a Supreme Court judge, Justice Nagarathna has been part of several Constitution Bench decisions and is known for her independent thinking and impactful dissents. Notably, she was the sole dissenter in the Constitution Bench verdict that upheld the Centre’s 2016 demonetisation scheme, where she held that the Reserve Bank of India had failed to apply its mind independently to the government's proposal.\n\nHer contributions to constitutional jurisprudence and her upcoming role as the first woman CJI make her tenure a landmark in the history of the Indian judiciary.\n\nC 23, Lajpat Nagar 3\nNew Delhi 110024, India\n\n info@thelawadvice.com\n +91 78270 83514\n\nCopyright 2022.

The plea also seeks the formulation of a comprehensive central law governing these activities.\n\nA bench comprising Justices Surya Kant and N.K. Singh issued a notice to the Central Government, seeking its response. However, the Court refrained from issuing notices to state governments at this stage.\n\nFiled as a Public Interest Litigation (PIL), the petition has been submitted by an individual who identifies himself as a prominent social activist and the President of the Global Peace Initiative, an organisation committed to promoting peace and justice worldwide. According to him, the plea aims to protect millions of Indians and uphold the democratic values of the nation by eliminating the menace of unregulated betting apps.\n\nThe petition cites a First Information Report (FIR) registered in Telangana in March against 25 Bollywood celebrities, cricketers, and influencers for allegedly misleading the public through their promotion of betting platforms. It also references a news report about 24 suicides in Telangana, reportedly linked to debts accrued from online betting.\n\nThe petitioner argues that the unregulated nature of online betting and gambling — often masked as fantasy sports or skill-based games — poses a serious threat to the country's youth and vulnerable citizens. He emphasizes that betting, whether online or offline, is fundamentally a game of chance rather than skill, and thus qualifies as gambling under many state laws, including the Public Gambling Act, 1867. The absence of a uniform central law further exacerbates the issue, he contends.\n\nDescribing the plea as a move in the \"larger public interest\", the petitioner stresses the urgent need to protect young Indians from what he calls an exploitative and dangerous industry.\n\nHe also claims international recognition for his peace efforts, stating that he has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by multiple countries — including the US, Norway, Sudan, and India — and has been instrumental in preventing several major conflicts and rescuing over 300 orphans and street children globally.\n\nC 23, Lajpat Nagar 3\nNew Delhi 110024, India\n\n info@thelawadvice.com\n +91 78270 83514\n\nCopyright 2022.

The Division Bench of Justices Inderjeet Singh and Anand Sharma issued notices to top state officials, including the Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Social Justice and Empowerment, and the Principal Secretary, Local Self Government Department, demanding an immediate explanation on continued violations.\n\nThe PIL was filed by the Snehansh Foundation, a social justice organization working in the field of manual scavenger rehabilitation. The petition was prompted by the tragic death of three sanitation workers in Bikaner’s Mukta Prasad Colony on May 5, 2025, due to asphyxiation while cleaning a septic tank without proper safety equipment. The petitioner cited that this incident was not isolated but part of a disturbing trend, with over 11 similar deaths reported across Rajasthan in the past two months alone.\n\nJustice Inderjeet Singh observed, “Despite the prohibition under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, the deaths continue unabated. This reflects a glaring lapse in enforcement and governance.” The Court also expressed dismay that the Safai Karamchari Commission had failed to effectively monitor or intervene in such high-risk operations.\n\nThe petition requested the Court to direct:\n1. A comprehensive state-wide audit of sanitation work involving human entry into hazardous spaces.\n2. Formation of a high-level monitoring committee headed by a retired High Court judge.\n3. Real-time public disclosure of safety fund allocations and utilization by municipalities.\n4. Mandatory deployment of mechanized cleaning solutions.\n\nThe bench further remarked: “This Court cannot be a silent spectator when lives are being lost due to administrative apathy. Human life is not expendable, and the constitutional guarantee of the Right to Life must be upheld for all citizens, especially the marginalized.”\n\nThe matter has been listed for further hearing on June 10, 2025, with the Court directing the State to file a detailed affidavit outlining past incidents, rehabilitation measures, and protocols implemented since 2013.\n\nThe case marks a significant judicial intervention into the persisting problem of caste-based sanitation labor and affirms the High Court’s constitutional mandate to uphold human dignity.","excerpt":"The Rajasthan High Court has sought a response from the state government on the increasing number of manual scavenging deaths, emphasizing the need for immediate action and accountability.","category":"High Courts","subcategory":"Rajasthan High Court","tags":["Rajasthan High Court","Manual Scavenging","Human Rights","Public Interest Litigation","Snehansh Foundation"],"source":"Legal Nest","image":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1182825/pexels-photo-1182825.jpeg","image_caption":"High Courts - Legal proceedings","image_alt":null,"image_credit":null,"pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1htCjflGnzDpicK-hCPSFBY6wG2HmpRoM/view?usp=sharing","author_bio":null,"is_featured":false,"mongo_id":"68366fe9e82bb082f904f534"}]

The petition was filed by Nikhil Upadhyay, who has sought to challenge the constitutional validity of several sections of the Waqf Act, 1995, as amended by the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025.\n\nAt the outset, CJI Gavai questioned the maintainability of the petition due to delay. “We will dismiss on the ground of delay. You are challenging the 1995 Act in 2025. Why should challenge to 1995 Act be allowed in 2025?” he asked. Advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, appearing for the petitioner, responded that the 2013 amendment was also under challenge. However, the CJI reiterated concerns over the delay, saying, “Even then, 2013 to 2025—12 years. There is delay.”\n\nUpadhyay then pointed out that the Supreme Court is already entertaining petitions filed in 2020–21 that challenge the Places of Worship Act, 1991, and the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992.\n\nAdditional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati submitted that the Court had previously not agreed to hear a challenge to the Waqf Act, 1995, along with petitions concerning the 2025 Amendment. However, she expressed no objection to the present petition being tagged with the earlier one challenging the 1995 Act.\n\nFollowing the submissions, the bench issued notice and tagged the petition with the ongoing matter. The Union government and all State/UTs have been named as respondents.\n\nIn the petition—Nikhil Upadhyay v. Union of India, W.P.(C) No. 502/2025—the petitioner contends that several sections of the Waqf Act violate fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15, 21, 25, 26, and 27 of the Constitution. The challenge has been raised against Sections 3(r), 4, 5, 6(1), 7(1), 8, 28, 29, 33, 36, 41, 52, 83, 85, 89, and 101 of the Act.\n\nThe petitioner argued that the Waqf Act is discriminatory as it creates a separate legal framework for the administration of Muslim charitable properties, while no such law exists for the religious properties of other communities. He asserted the need for a common and uniform law governing religious trusts and endowments.\n\nSpecific objections include:\n\nThe definition of Waqf under Section 3(r), described as a \"permanent dedication\", which the petitioner argues is vague and beyond judicially manageable standards. He suggests this should be limited to properties acquired in accordance with law.\n\nThe definition of Mutawalli (manager of a Waqf) is alleged to be vague and uncertain.\n\nThe petitioner also objects to public funds being used to cover the cost of verification and survey of Waqf properties, while no similar state-sponsored surveys exist for other religious institutions.\n\nThe matter is now pending further hearing as part of the batch challenging the Waqf Act.\n\nC 23, Lajpat Nagar 3\nNew Delhi 110024, India\n\n info@thelawadvice.com\n +91 78270 83514\n\nCopyright 2022.

Video cameras shall be kept in the custody of Senior Advocate Vijay Hansaria,” the Court stated.\n\nDuring the hearing, a lawyer raised concerns regarding women's representation in the SCBA executive. She referred to the Court’s earlier directions mandating 33 percent representation for women and argued that the Election Committee failed to implement this, declaring results purely on merit. According to her, at least two senior executive posts should have been reserved exclusively for women, irrespective of the number of women who were elected based on votes.\n\nIn response, the Court clarified that its previous orders emphasized \"representation\" rather than \"reservation\" in the strict constitutional sense.\n\nJustice Surya Kant noted, “The intent was to ensure meaningful participation of women in the SCBA, not to apply the concept of reservation as used in public employment and services.”\n\nThe Bench also pointed out that three out of six elected members are women, thereby achieving the objective of inclusive representation. “No further reservation is required,” the Court said.\n\nThe Court remarked that any grievances regarding the Election Committee’s conduct should have been raised during the election process to allow timely intervention. Nonetheless, it assured members that serious allegations, if substantiated, would be personally examined by the judges—provided the complaints are not merely rooted in dissatisfaction with the results.\n\nIn addition, the Bench acknowledged calls for electoral reforms. One notable suggestion was to bar Election Committee members from contesting elections or supporting candidates to maintain impartiality.\n\nJustice Kant emphasized the need for neutrality: “The impartiality of the Election Committee is essential.”\n\nThe Court asked that all suggestions regarding irregularities and reforms be submitted to the Registrar of the Supreme Court and preferably before the next hearing.\n\nThe matter is scheduled for further hearing on July 28.\n\nC 23, Lajpat Nagar 3\nNew Delhi 110024, India\n\n info@thelawadvice.com\n +91 78270 83514\n\nCopyright 2022.

It is only on account of total lack of application of mind and exercise of powers in an arbitrary manner that this Court is flooded with petitions after petitions challenging the orders of the Pharmacy Council of India\", observed a bench of Justice BR Gavai (now CJI) and Justice AG Masih.\n\nWhile setting aside the Pharmacy Council's rejections of certain institutions' approvals, the Court directed the concerned Registrar to forward a copy of the order to the Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, to take suitable action so that \"such unwarranted litigation\" can be avoided in future. \nThe Court was dealing with a batch of 14 cases filed by pharma colleges. In one of the cases, permission for extension of D.Pharm course was granted to the petitioner-institution, subject to inspection throughout the year. However, within a few months, the approval was rejected on the ground that the institution had not submitted its satisfactory compliance regarding various factors.\n\nThe Court opined that before rejecting the approval, Pharmacy Council ought to have carried out an inspection and given the petitioner-institution an opportunity to rectify any lacunae found. \"We find that the respondent/Pharmacy Council of India has acted in an arbitrary manner and therefore the decision dated 09.12.2024 is liable to be set aside\", it said. \n\nInsofar as the Pharmacy Council regularized the said institution's approval for 2024-25, in view of admissions granted to 46 students following the initial grant of permission, the Court observed that the Council had shown a \"charitable attitude\". However, it added, \"when an action of a statutory body is likely to affect the careers of large number of students, such bodies are expected to act in a manner which is in consonance with the principles of natural justice and non-arbitrariness.\"\n\nIn another \"classic example\" of Pharmacy Council's \"arbitrary attitude\", the Court noted that grant of extension of another institution's approval was subject to inspection throughout the year. An inspection was conducted and no deficiencies pointed out, yet the Pharmacy Council rejected the institution's approval. In this backdrop, the Court observed, \n\n\"It is, thus, clear that either the inspection report is not correct, or the Council has not applied its mind to the inspection report. As already observed by us in the matter of even date, we have observed that the respondent/Pharmacy Council of India cannot act in an arbitrary manner when such an action adversely affects the careers of thousands of students.\"\n\nAppearance: Solicitor General Tushar Mehta; Senior Advocates Devadutt Kamat, Sanjay Sharawat and Neeraj Jain\n\nCase Title: SHREE RAM COLLEGE OF PHARMACY Versus PHARMACY COUNCIL OF INDIA, W.P.(C) No. 24/2025 (and connected cases)","excerpt":"The Supreme Court slammed the Pharmacy Council of India over arbitrary rejection of pharma college approvals and directed the concerned Registrar to forward a copy of the order to the Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.","category":"Supreme Court","subcategory":"Supreme Court","tags":["Supreme Court","Pharmacy Council","Education","Law"],"source":"Legal Nest","image":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1601299/pexels-photo-1601299.jpeg","image_caption":"Image related to: Supreme Court Slams Pharmacy Council Of India Over Arbitrary Rejection Of Pharma College Approvals","image_alt":null,"image_credit":null,"pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1htCjflGnzDpicK-hCPSFBY6wG2HmpRoM/view?usp=sharing","author_bio":null,"is_featured":false,"mongo_id":"68366fe9e82bb082f904f530"},{"title":"Supreme Court Recognizes Maternity Leave as Fundamental Reproductive Right","slug":"supreme-court-recognizes-maternity-leave-as-fundamental-reproductive-right","author":"Legal Nest","published_date":"2025-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","content":"In a landmark judgment on Friday, the Supreme Court of India declared that maternity leave is not just a workplace benefit but a fundamental part of women's reproductive rights.\n\nThe ruling came from a bench comprising Justice Abhay S. Oka and Justice Ujjal Bhuiyan, who emphasized that no institution—public or private—can deny a woman her entitlement to maternity leave.\n\nThe case was brought by a government school teacher from Tamil Nadu, who had been denied maternity leave following the birth of her child from her second marriage. Authorities refused her request on the basis of a state rule limiting maternity benefits to the first two children.\n\nThe petitioner argued that although she had two children from her first marriage, she had not availed of maternity leave or benefits at that time, as she was not employed. She began working only after her second marriage and sought leave for her third child—her first while in service.\n\nRepresented by Advocate K.V. Muthukumar, the petitioner contended that the state's decision was discriminatory and infringed upon her fundamental rights, especially since she had not previously benefited from the state’s maternity provisions.\n\nThe Supreme Court sided with the petitioner, effectively expanding the interpretation of maternity benefits. It ruled that maternity leave must be seen as an essential component of a woman’s reproductive rights, reinforcing the state's obligation to uphold those rights.\n\nThe judgment also revisits the broader framework of the Maternity Benefit Act. As per existing provisions, women are entitled to 26 weeks of paid maternity leave, an increase from the earlier 12 weeks following a 2017 amendment. The law also extends 12 weeks of leave to women who adopt a child.\n\nThis decision marks a significant step forward in reinforcing gender equity and protecting the rights of working women in India.\n\nC 23, Lajpat Nagar 3\nNew Delhi 110024, India\n\n info@thelawadvice.com\n +91 78270 83514\n\nCopyright 2022.

Upon his switch to another bank, the Appellant made the Respondent pay ₹2 lakh penalty, against which the Respondent filed a writ petition before the High Court. Aggrieved by the High Court's decision declaring the execution of bond as restrictive trade practices under Section 27 of the Contract Act, the Bank appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nSetting aside the High Court's decision, the judgment authored by Justice Bagchi emphasized that exclusivity clauses cannot be termed as restrictive of trade practices under Section 27 of the Contract Act, as such clauses do not restrict future employment but only impose a financial penalty for early exit.\n\n\"A plain reading of clause 11(k) shows restraint was imposed on the respondent to work for a minimum term i.e., three years and in default to pay liquidated damages of ₹2 Lakhs. The clause sought to impose a restriction on the respondent's option to resign and thereby perpetuated the employment contract for a specified term. The object of the restrictive covenant was in furtherance of the employment contract and not to restrain future employment. Hence, it cannot be said to be violative of Section 27 of the Contract Act.\"\n\nThe Court rejected the Respondent's argument that such exclusivity clauses were unconscionable and part of a standard-form contract with no negotiation scope. Instead, the Court stated such clause to be reasonable given the fact that public sector undertakings need to retain skilled staff, and early exit prompts them to incur high costs of re-recruitment.\n\n\"The appellant-bank is a public sector undertaking and cannot resort to private or ad-hoc appointments through private contracts. An untimely resignation would require the Bank to undertake a prolix and expensive recruitment process involving open advertisement, fair competitive procedure lest the appointment falls foul of the constitutional mandate under Articles 14 and 16.\", the court said.\n\nThus, the Court justified the imposition of ₹2 lakhs penalty, stating that it was not excessive for a Respondent, who was a Senior Manager (MMG-III) drawing a lucrative salary.","excerpt":"The Supreme Court upheld a bank's employment bond penalty, outlining key principles for interpreting standard-form contracts and their enforceability under Indian law.","category":"Supreme Court","subcategory":"Supreme Court","tags":["Supreme Court","Employment Bond","Justice JB Pardiwala and Justice R Mahadevan","Order I Rule 10 CPC","SULTHAN SAID IBRAHIM VERSUS PRAKASAN & ORS."],"source":"Legal Nest","image":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1601299/pexels-photo-1601299.jpeg","image_caption":"Supreme Court - Legal proceedings","image_alt":null,"image_credit":null,"pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1htCjflGnzDpicK-hCPSFBY6wG2HmpRoM/view?usp=sharing","author_bio":null,"is_featured":false,"mongo_id":"68366fe9e82bb082f904f531"},{"title":"Delhi High Court Denies Bail in Army Espionage Case, Citing National Security Concerns","slug":"delhi-hc-espionage-bail-denied","author":"Legal Nest","published_date":"2025-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","content":"The Delhi High Court has rejected the bail plea of Mohsin Khan, an accused in an Army espionage case, citing grave concerns over national security.\n\nJustice Swarana Kanta Sharma, who presided over the matter, underscored that acts of espionage strike at the very core of the nation's integrity and sovereignty, and must therefore be dealt with stringently.\n\nThe prosecution alleged that Khan played a central role in transmitting confidential information related to the Indian Army to the Pakistan High Commission.

His appointment was formally notified following the recommendation by the Supreme Court Collegium led by Chief Justice Gawai. Presently Justice Bishnoi is serving as Chief Justice of Guahati High Court.\n\nBorn in 1967, Justice Bishnoi’s legal career spans over three decades. He enrolled as an advocate in 1990 and built a strong reputation in civil, criminal, constitutional, and service law matters. He practiced extensively before the Rajasthan High Court and subordinate courts, showcasing a deep understanding of procedural and substantive law.\n\nHe was appointed as a judge of the Rajasthan High Court in 2012 and later became the senior-most puisne judge. During his tenure, he delivered several significant judgments, particularly in criminal law and public interest litigations.\n\nJustice Bishnoi is widely respected for his no-nonsense judicial approach and clarity in reasoning. Some of his notable contributions include:\n\nUpholding women's rights in marital and property disputes.\n\nAdvocating for judicial transparency and effective case management.\n\nStrongly emphasizing accountability in public institutions, especially in cases involving administrative lapses.\n\nHis verdicts have often balanced legal propriety with social sensitivity, marking him as a judge with both intellect and empathy.\n\nThe Supreme Court Collegium, while recommending his elevation, acknowledged Justice Bishnoi's:\n\nMerit, integrity, and judicial acumen\n\nExtensive experience of over a decade on the High Court Bench\n\nStrong regional representation from Rajasthan, ensuring geographical diversity in the apex court\n\nIt is notable that at the time of his elevation, Justice Sandeep Mehta in the Supreme Court is from the Rajasthan High Court.\n\nWhat sets Justice Bishnoi apart is his grassroots understanding of legal realities. Coming from a state with a vast rural population and complex social dynamics, his judgments often reflect a keen awareness of the common citizen's challenges in accessing justice.\n\nAs a Supreme Court judge, it is expected that he will bring this real-world insight to constitutional interpretation, especially in matters concerning criminal justice reforms, rural access to justice, and gender equity.\n\nSenior advocates and members of the Bar across Rajasthan and Delhi have welcomed his elevation:\n\n\"Justice Bishnoi’s presence in the Supreme Court will reinforce practical reasoning and constitutional discipline,\" said a senior advocate from Jodhpur.\n\n\"He represents a rare combination of humility, diligence, and judicial courage,\" added a retired High Court judge who worked closely with him.\n\nWith several crucial matters pending before the Supreme Court—including those related to criminal procedure reforms, service law interpretation, and constitutional challenges—Justice Bishnoi’s contribution will be closely watched.\n\nHis elevation comes at a time when judicial efficiency, sensitivity, and reform-oriented thinking are the need of the hour.

These new brands allegedly benefitted from significantly larger order volumes, often exceeding regulatory limits.\n\nThe report further claims that kickbacks were collected per case—₹150 for low-cost brands, ₹200 for mid-range, and up to ₹600 for premium brands. These funds were allegedly routed through Reddy and distributed among leaders of the Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP).\n\nThe SIT has described the case as involving criminal conspiracy, cheating, criminal breach of trust, corruption, and money laundering.

The High Court cited the 2002 judgment in the All India Judges Association case to deny the enhancement, interpreting it as a bar against such increases.\n\nHowever, on Monday, CJI Gavai referred to a more recent order in the same case involving the Telangana government, where a similar clarification was sought regarding increasing the retirement age to 61. In that instance, the Supreme Court had permitted the enhancement, finding no legal impediment.\n\n“In view of that order, we do not find any impediment in permitting the State of Madhya Pradesh to increase the retirement age of its judicial officers to 61 years,” said the CJI.\n\nThe bench added that the final decision would rest with the Madhya Pradesh High Court in its administrative capacity. If the High Court approves the proposal, the enhancement will stand permitted.\n\nC 23, Lajpat Nagar 3\nNew Delhi 110024, India\n\n info@thelawadvice.com\n +91 78270 83514\n\nCopyright 2022.

Oka, who demits office today.\n\nThe Supreme Court Collegium, comprising the five senior-most judges, plays a crucial role in the appointment of judges to the apex court and in the transfer of High Court judges. For High Court appointments, decisions are taken by the three senior-most judges of the Collegium.\n\nAt the beginning of Chief Justice DY Chandrachud’s tenure, the Collegium included Justices Surya Kant, Abhay S Oka, Vikram Nath, and JK Maheshwari. With Justice Oka’s retirement on May 24, Justice Nagarathna—currently the fifth senior-most judge—will step into the Collegium starting tomorrow.\n\nShe will remain a member of the Collegium until her retirement in October 2027, which includes her historic elevation as the 55th Chief Justice of India. Although her tenure as CJI will last only 36 days—from September 24 to October 29, 2027—it will mark a significant milestone as the first woman to hold the top judicial post in India. Her term will be the third-shortest for any CJI in Supreme Court history.\n\nJustice Nagarathna is the daughter of former Chief Justice of India ES Venkataramiah, who served as the 19th CJI. She began her legal practice in 1987 with KESVY & Co before shifting to independent practice in 1994, handling matters related to constitutional, administrative, commercial, and family laws.\n\nHer judicial career began with her appointment as an additional judge of the Karnataka High Court in 2008. She was made permanent in 2010 and later elevated to the Supreme Court on August 31, 2021.\n\nAs a Supreme Court judge, Justice Nagarathna has been part of several Constitution Bench decisions and is known for her independent thinking and impactful dissents. Notably, she was the sole dissenter in the Constitution Bench verdict that upheld the Centre’s 2016 demonetisation scheme, where she held that the Reserve Bank of India had failed to apply its mind independently to the government's proposal.\n\nHer contributions to constitutional jurisprudence and her upcoming role as the first woman CJI make her tenure a landmark in the history of the Indian judiciary.\n\nC 23, Lajpat Nagar 3\nNew Delhi 110024, India\n\n info@thelawadvice.com\n +91 78270 83514\n\nCopyright 2022.

The plea also seeks the formulation of a comprehensive central law governing these activities.\n\nA bench comprising Justices Surya Kant and N.K. Singh issued a notice to the Central Government, seeking its response. However, the Court refrained from issuing notices to state governments at this stage.\n\nFiled as a Public Interest Litigation (PIL), the petition has been submitted by an individual who identifies himself as a prominent social activist and the President of the Global Peace Initiative, an organisation committed to promoting peace and justice worldwide. According to him, the plea aims to protect millions of Indians and uphold the democratic values of the nation by eliminating the menace of unregulated betting apps.\n\nThe petition cites a First Information Report (FIR) registered in Telangana in March against 25 Bollywood celebrities, cricketers, and influencers for allegedly misleading the public through their promotion of betting platforms. It also references a news report about 24 suicides in Telangana, reportedly linked to debts accrued from online betting.\n\nThe petitioner argues that the unregulated nature of online betting and gambling — often masked as fantasy sports or skill-based games — poses a serious threat to the country's youth and vulnerable citizens. He emphasizes that betting, whether online or offline, is fundamentally a game of chance rather than skill, and thus qualifies as gambling under many state laws, including the Public Gambling Act, 1867. The absence of a uniform central law further exacerbates the issue, he contends.\n\nDescribing the plea as a move in the \"larger public interest\", the petitioner stresses the urgent need to protect young Indians from what he calls an exploitative and dangerous industry.\n\nHe also claims international recognition for his peace efforts, stating that he has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by multiple countries — including the US, Norway, Sudan, and India — and has been instrumental in preventing several major conflicts and rescuing over 300 orphans and street children globally.\n\nC 23, Lajpat Nagar 3\nNew Delhi 110024, India\n\n info@thelawadvice.com\n +91 78270 83514\n\nCopyright 2022.

The Division Bench of Justices Inderjeet Singh and Anand Sharma issued notices to top state officials, including the Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Social Justice and Empowerment, and the Principal Secretary, Local Self Government Department, demanding an immediate explanation on continued violations.\n\nThe PIL was filed by the Snehansh Foundation, a social justice organization working in the field of manual scavenger rehabilitation. The petition was prompted by the tragic death of three sanitation workers in Bikaner’s Mukta Prasad Colony on May 5, 2025, due to asphyxiation while cleaning a septic tank without proper safety equipment. The petitioner cited that this incident was not isolated but part of a disturbing trend, with over 11 similar deaths reported across Rajasthan in the past two months alone.\n\nJustice Inderjeet Singh observed, “Despite the prohibition under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, the deaths continue unabated. This reflects a glaring lapse in enforcement and governance.” The Court also expressed dismay that the Safai Karamchari Commission had failed to effectively monitor or intervene in such high-risk operations.\n\nThe petition requested the Court to direct:\n1. A comprehensive state-wide audit of sanitation work involving human entry into hazardous spaces.\n2. Formation of a high-level monitoring committee headed by a retired High Court judge.\n3. Real-time public disclosure of safety fund allocations and utilization by municipalities.\n4. Mandatory deployment of mechanized cleaning solutions.\n\nThe bench further remarked: “This Court cannot be a silent spectator when lives are being lost due to administrative apathy. Human life is not expendable, and the constitutional guarantee of the Right to Life must be upheld for all citizens, especially the marginalized.”\n\nThe matter has been listed for further hearing on June 10, 2025, with the Court directing the State to file a detailed affidavit outlining past incidents, rehabilitation measures, and protocols implemented since 2013.\n\nThe case marks a significant judicial intervention into the persisting problem of caste-based sanitation labor and affirms the High Court’s constitutional mandate to uphold human dignity.","excerpt":"The Rajasthan High Court has sought a response from the state government on the increasing number of manual scavenging deaths, emphasizing the need for immediate action and accountability.","category":"High Courts","subcategory":"Rajasthan High Court","tags":["Rajasthan High Court","Manual Scavenging","Human Rights","Public Interest Litigation","Snehansh Foundation"],"source":"Legal Nest","image":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1182825/pexels-photo-1182825.jpeg","image_caption":"High Courts - Legal proceedings","image_alt":null,"image_credit":null,"pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1htCjflGnzDpicK-hCPSFBY6wG2HmpRoM/view?usp=sharing","author_bio":null,"is_featured":false,"mongo_id":"68366fe9e82bb082f904f534"}]

However, she was declared medically unfit during the medical examination on account of low hemoglobin levels, a temporary condition resulting from heavy menstrual bleeding.\n\nPresiding over the case, Justice Anoop Kumar Dhand delivered a strongly worded judgment: “Disqualifying a woman for admission to a professional course solely based on temporary menstruation-induced anemia is discriminatory and unconstitutional. Such decisions fail to take into account biological realities and reinforce patriarchal barriers in professional education.”\n\nThe Court noted that a subsequent medical examination ordered during the pendency of the writ petition showed that Sakshi’s hemoglobin levels had returned to normal, and she was found medically fit. The judge observed: “Medical ineligibility must be based on sustained incapacity or permanent conditions. A passing phase of low hemoglobin cannot be the sole ground for rejection.”\n\nThe judgment emphasized that educational institutions, especially those linked with national defense and public service, must adopt a compassionate, science-based, and gender-sensitive approach when dealing with women's health conditions. “Menstruation is a natural biological function, not a disability,” Justice Dhand stated.\n\nThe Court also referred to Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution, which guarantee equality before the law and prohibit discrimination based on sex. “It is imperative for public institutions to promote inclusive policies rather than rigid and outdated medical criteria,” the Court held.\n\nAccordingly, the Rajasthan High Court quashed the AFMS decision and ordered immediate admission of the petitioner into the 2025-26 BSc Nursing batch, ensuring she would not lose her academic year.\n\nThe judgment has been hailed by women’s rights groups as a progressive move and a precedent for inclusive medical admissions going forward.","excerpt":"Rajasthan High Court orders Armed Forces Medical Services to admit student rejected due to menstruation-related anemia, calling the disqualification discriminatory.","category":"High Courts","subcategory":"Rajasthan High Court","tags":["Rajasthan High Court","Women's Rights","Education Equality","Menstrual Health","Sakshi Choudhary","Medical Disqualification"],"source":"Legal Nest","image":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/8369151/pexels-photo-8369151.jpeg","image_caption":"Image related to: Rajasthan HC Slams Gender Bias: Orders AFMS to Admit Student Rejected for Menstrual Anemia","image_alt":null,"image_credit":null,"pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1htCjflGnzDpicK-hCPSFBY6wG2HmpRoM/view?usp=sharing","author_bio":null,"is_featured":false,"mongo_id":"68366fe9e82bb082f904f535"},{"title":"Supreme Court: Missed Files Can Still Be Filed","slug":"supreme-court-missed-files-can-still-be-filed","author":"Legal Nest","published_date":"2025-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","content":"New Delhi, May 23, 2025 — In a significant clarification on criminal procedure, the Supreme Court of India has ruled that the prosecution may be permitted to produce documents that were inadvertently left out at the time of filing the chargesheet, as long as it does not infringe on the rights of the accused.\n\nThe ruling came from a bench led by Justices Abhay S. Oka and Augustine George Masih, who emphasized that procedural lapses should not obstruct the path of justice when the overall investigation remains intact and fair trial standards are maintained.\n\nThe case under scrutiny involved the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which sought to introduce certain compact discs (CDs) that were referred to in the supplementary chargesheet but not physically submitted with it. The trial court had allowed the inclusion of these materials, and the decision was later upheld by the High Court. The accused, opposing this development, challenged the decision before the Supreme Court.\n\nReaffirming the authority of the prosecution, the Court cited established jurisprudence that supports allowing additional documents to be introduced, even after the initial filing. The justices clarified that the timing of such production—whether before or after the chargesheet—does not invalidate its admissibility, provided it aligns with legal procedure and the defense is granted adequate opportunity to respond.\n\nImportantly, the Court noted that the accused’s right to a fair trial remains paramount, and any newly introduced evidence must be disclosed transparently, allowing for cross-examination and defense rebuttal if necessary.\n\nThis ruling ensures a balanced approach—acknowledging the logistical realities of complex investigations while safeguarding procedural fairness.\n\nLegal Impact:\n•Reinforces that criminal trials are not bound strictly by clerical completeness at the chargesheet stage.\n•Offers prosecuting agencies legal room to correct omissions without needing to restart proceedings.\n•Affirms the judiciary’s focus on substantive justice over technicalities.\n\nC 23, Lajpat Nagar 3\nNew Delhi 110024, India\n\n info@thelawadvice.com\n +91 78270 83514\n\nCopyright 2022.
